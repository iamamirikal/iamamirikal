My Skills in SQL

Data Definition Language (DDL)
Creating and altering database objects like tables.
Managing constraints and keys to ensure data integrity.
Defining and managing database schemas.

Data Manipulation Language (DML)
Sub-queries
I excel at crafting sub-queries to retrieve and manipulate data within complex queries. Sub-queries help me efficiently retrieve specific subsets of data from a larger dataset.

Joins
I'm skilled in using various types of joins, such as INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, RIGHT JOIN, and FULL JOIN, to combine data from multiple tables and extract meaningful insights.

String Functions
I have a deep understanding of SQL string functions, which allow me to manipulate and format text data effectively. These functions help me clean and process data for analysis.

Math Functions
I utilize SQL math functions to perform calculations and aggregations on numerical data. These functions help me extract valuable insights and metrics from datasets.

Window Functions
Window functions enable me to perform calculations across a set of rows related to the current row. I use them for tasks like calculating moving averages, ranking data, and identifying trends over time.

Common Table Expressions (CTE)
CTEs are a powerful tool for creating temporary result sets within SQL queries. I leverage CTEs for complex queries and simplifying code readability.

Tools
In addition to SQL, I'm proficient in using the following tools to enhance my data analysis and reporting capabilities:

Microsoft Excel: I use Excel for data cleaning, transformation, and visualization.
Power BI: I create interactive and insightful reports and dashboards to communicate data-driven insights effectively.
Feel free to explore the code and projects in my repositories to see how I apply these SQL skills and tools to solve real-world data challenges.

If you have any questions or would like to collaborate on a project, please don't hesitate to reach out.

Happy coding!
